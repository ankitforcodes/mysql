1. Count number of returned rows:
	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM books;
	SELECT COUNT(author_fname) FROM books;
	
2. Return unique rows:
	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT author_fname) FROM books;
	ELECT COUNT(DISTINCT author_lname, author_fname) FROM books;

3. GROUP BY:
	SELECT author_fname, author_lname, COUNT(*) FROM books GROUP BY author_lname;
	SELECT author_fname, author_lname, COUNT(*) FROM books GROUP BY author_lname, author_fname;

4. MIN and MAX:
	SELECT MIN(pages) FROM books;
	SELECT MAX(pages) FROM books;
	
	SELECT title, pages FROM books 
	WHERE pages = (SELECT Max(pages) FROM books); 
 	
	SELECT title, pages FROM books 
	ORDER BY pages ASC LIMIT 1;
	
	SELECT
	  author_fname,
	  author_lname,
	  Max(pages)
	FROM books
	GROUP BY author_lname,
		 author_fname;
