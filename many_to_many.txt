1. Multiple foreign keys:
	CREATE TABLE reviews (
		id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
		rating DECIMAL(2,1),
		series_id INT,
		reviewer_id INT,
		FOREIGN KEY(series_id) REFERENCES series(id),
		FOREIGN KEY(reviewer_id) REFERENCES reviewers(id)
	);
	
2. Condition on resultant rows of JOIN operation:
	SELECT title AS unreviewed_series
	FROM series
	LEFT JOIN reviews
		ON series.id = reviews.series_id
	WHERE rating IS NULL;
	
3. Multiple JOINS:
	SELECT 
    title,
    rating,
    CONCAT(first_name,' ', last_name) AS reviewer
	FROM reviewers
	INNER JOIN reviews 
		ON reviewers.id = reviews.reviewer_id
	INNER JOIN series
		ON series.id = reviews.series_id
	ORDER BY title;
