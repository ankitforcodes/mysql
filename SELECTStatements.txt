1. Select all columns:
	SELECT * FROM cats; 

2. Select one column:
	SELECT name FROM cats;

3. Select multiple column:
	SELECT name, age FROM cats;
	
4. WHERE clause (equality, exact matches):
	SELECT * FROM cats WHERE age=4;
	SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name='Egg';
	SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name='egG'; 
	
5. Using aliases for returned columns:
	SELECT cat_id AS id, name FROM cats;

6. Distinct:
	SELECT DISTINCT author_lname FROM books;
	SELECT DISTINCT author_fname, author_lname FROM books;
	
7. ORDER BY: Sorting our records:
	SELECT author_lname FROM books ORDER BY author_lname;
	SELECT title, released_year, pages FROM books ORDER BY released_year;
	SELECT released_year FROM books ORDER BY released_year DESC;
	
8. LIMIT
	SELECT title FROM books LIMIT 10;
	
	SELECT title, released_year FROM books 
	ORDER BY released_year DESC LIMIT 5;
	
	SELECT title, released_year FROM books 
	ORDER BY released_year DESC LIMIT 10,1;
	
9. LIKE: Better searching:
	SELECT title, author_fname FROM books WHERE author_fname LIKE '%da%';		-- any string that has word 'da' in it
	SELECT title FROM books WHERE  title LIKE '%the';				-- any string that ends with 'the'
	SELECT title, stock_quantity FROM books WHERE stock_quantity LIKE '__';		-- any stcoks that is 2 characters long
